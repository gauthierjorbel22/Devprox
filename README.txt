For the first question:
The form.php file is the one to run. It contains a form where you can 
fill in with data and insert to the database. 
#The folder Question 1 has 3 files in it:
 - db.php which contains all the db configuration
 - form.php which contains a form that the user must interact with. 
 - user.sql which is the exported db table to use for this task. 

#The folder Question 2 has Two subfolders: output which will contain 
the output.csv file that will be generated by the program. 
importFile folder which contains a small program that can allow you to 
import the csv file to the database. 

#Within importFile folder, we have config.php functions.php and index.php files.
index.php is the main file to run on the browser. It allows us to import the csv in the database. 
We also have a record.sql which is a the exported database table to use for question number 2
functions.php within importFile dir contains the logic behind the import file nad config.php has the 
db configurations. 


#In the global Question2 dir, we have two main files: form.php which is the 
main entry point UI for question 2. This form prompts the user to enter the number 
of records he wants the csv to contain. 
index.php contains the logic behind the csv file generation and random details. 


eg: Question2, first run form.php then once the csv is generated in output/output.csv;
then run importFile/index.php to import the data in the database.


PS: The form.php file in Question2 dir something fires the form on refresh. 
This may generate a blank output.csv file. 
If such happen we can just delete the output.csv then enter the proper number to geneate the csv.
